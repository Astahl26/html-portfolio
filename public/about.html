<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I got into web development because I love coding and creating things. Since I was little I've always loved puzzles 
  and art, which web development felt like a combination of those things. I also love typing away on a keyboard, something
  about it just feels so soothing. I switched to learning web development because I felt it would be a job that would bring
  me more oppurtunity to do things that make me happy and feel like I'm creating something.

<p>People in my life know me to be upbeat, silly, and caring. I've also been said to be detail oriented and pretty good at 
  noticing when something is out of place. I have a big sense of humor, as you can probably see from my movie project. My 
  friends refer to me as a raccoon due to me staying up all night, having dark rings under my eyes, and usually scavaging 
  for snacks.

<p>As for my background, I was born in Washington state, and raised in Utah. At 19 I moved to North Carolina, and then moved 
  to Virgina when I was 28. I love the trees out here but also miss the big mountains. The hikes are beautiful in all the 
  states I've lived in though. Plus it's nice being close to a beach! Other things I love out here are the fireflies, my 
  friends I have here, and not getting buried in snow during the winter. Thank you for checking out my portfolio!
