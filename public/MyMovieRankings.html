<h2>My Top 3 Favorite Movies to Watch While Eating My Stolen Trash Snacks.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3</h3>
<p>I mean this whole movie is centered around how smart Raccoons are, so obvious choice there.</p>

<h3>Sausage Party</h3>
<p>I love watching my delicious snacks scream in agony.</p>

<h3>Elf</h3>
<p>This is my favorite because I just rewatch the scene where he's attacked by the raccoon over and over again, mwahahahaha.</p>
